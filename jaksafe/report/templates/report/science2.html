            <h3>1. General Overview</h3>
            <p>Data is playing significant role for disaster management, it will help decision maker to analyze the situation on their decision making process. Therefore, the more detail your data, the better result you will delivered. JakSAFE is a quick estimation tools designed to estimate Damage and Loss due to Flood disaster in Jakarta. Estimating Damage and Loss is a complex process and need sufficient information and appropriate methodology.</p>
            <p>JakSAFE Team has collected data for JakSAFE input which classified into: hazard, exposure other supporting information. With those data we build an assumption to precede the calculation.</p>
            <p>This page will elaborate the detail of methodology and science behind the estimation of JakSAFE Application. It will describe the use, granularity, resolution, year updated, assumption and other information parameter which is needed by JakSAFE. Mostly the the data obtained from Disaster Management Agency of Jakarta, other government institutions, private institutions, associations, and other agencies.</p>
            <p>JakSAFE deliver the damage and loss calculation value in Rupiahs. The damage and loss value also can be drilled down until RW Boundary, the smallest administrative level. JakSAFE data processing involving Economic Valuation, Geographic Information System, and also Database Management. For further detail of the whole process will be discussed on next chapter.</p>
            <p>This page also dedicated to all researchers in the world which focus on Damage & Loss Assessment due to flood and challenge them to contribute and involve on the improvement of JakSAFE. Since the beginning of the project, JakSAFE is Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) project, and published under the GPL V3 license. Everybody are welcome to put Inputs on design, User Interfaces, architecture, data, and other this that can be obtained.</p>

            <h4>2.1. Administration Boundary</h4>
            <p>Jakarta as a Province, has five different kind of administrative boundary described by chart and maps below, from the highest to the lowest level. The RT boundary was the lowest boundary level in Jakarta. However, the process of RT boundary mapping is not completed yet, for now it is only covering 35 Kelurahans (Villages) in Jakarta. The presence of Administration Boundary Map on damage and loss calculation in JakSAFE is very significant, because the hazard information (flood report) was reported based on its location, and then displayed using these maps. Therefore, the more detailed your map, the better the information.</p>

            <p>Exposure data in JakSAFE are every physical asset located or has taken place in Jakarta region. The exposure data was built from various data, from parcel data, building footprints, and road data, to the aggregate data information. Therefore, we will describe each data below:</p>

DKI Jakarta has 261 village (not include Kepulauan Seribu) located in five administrative city, but we only have 193 village of P4T Data, so there are 68 village not covered by P4T data.

            <h5>2.2.3. Road Data</h5>
            <p>We are using road data from OpenstreetMap as road expossure input for JakSAFE. Road data from OpenstreetMap is in shapefile format, and already have information about road type in it. The shapefile has information about the name of the road, type of road, and also length. However, Damage and Loss estimation for "VEHICLE" asset is counted based on number of vehicle on inudated road. Therefore, we need to add vehicle volume information to road shapefile. We are using vehicle volume data obtained from Transportation Agency. The process of inputing vehicle volume information is done using database software (PostGIS and PostgreSQL) to ease database management. After those stages were done, the data from PostGIS is exported into shapefile and generate result like picture below:</p>

            <h5>2.2.4. Aggregate Data</h5>
            <p>The ideal expossure data requirements for JakSAFE are expected in the spatial features such as polygon or polyline. Data collected from related institutions comes in various formats, one of the is aggregate data. However, with some assumption and rationale, we still can make use of those data to enrich JakSAFE exposure database. The example of aggregate data was shown like table below:</p>

            <h5>2.2.5. Challenge</h5>
            <p>The ideal data for making exposure dataset is data in spatial format, with detail information of every building or parcel as the attribute. The existing JakSAFE exposure dataset was combined from several data sources, but if the exposure dataset was updated with more detailed spatial information in the future, it would deliver better estimation for damage and loss.</p>

        <div id="section2-3-2">
            <h5>2.3.2. Challenge</h5>
            <p>As we discussed above, the smallest boundary in Jakarta Province are RT Boundary. However, the mapping of Jakarta RT Boundary is not completed yet, it is only covering 35 Village (excluding Keppulauan Seribu). The ideal situation is when the Jakarta RT Boundary Maps is completed, and the hazard information gathered using RT Boundary as unit analysis, rather than RW Boundary. Therefore, it would deliver better estimation for damage and loss.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="section2-4">
            <h4>2.4. Assumptions</h4>
            <p>After processing the hazard and exposure data, we have found the number of building affected by flood, but the question is how we change those number into value in rupiahs? Therefore, there has to be assumption to converting the affected building into rupiahs. To ease the assumption, we need to classify the exposure data into different assets, subsector, and sectors first. Then the assumption is made as a damage and loss matrix in rupiahs of every asset, where every category of asset has its own rupiah damage value and loss value in rupiah. However, sometimes the unit for calculating various assets is not the same, like when calculating building we use unit number of building, however in calculating road we have to use metric unit, and when calculating lake we need to use area as unit. Therefore, we also need to define method of calculation on every category of asset. The other thing to consider when making damage and loss value is that type of flood is have different value, like the loss of building that was inundated by 50 cm of flood will be different with the other that inundated by 200 cm of flood, or the damage value of building that was inundated by flood in 1 day will be different with other that inundated in 5 days, so we also need to categorize the hazard. To summarize it all, we need to categorize the hazard and classifying the exposure data to be able make damage and loss value assumption in rupiah, we are going to dig deeper into the rationale of every assumption on the next chapter.</p>
