"Flood is the most common and frequent disaster in Indonesia. Among area in "
"Indonesia, Jakarta is one of the regions which have a high risk of flooding. "
"Losses caused by flooding in early February 2007 reached 5.16 trillion "
"rupiahs and is expected to reach 20 trillion rupiahs in flood that occurred "
"in January 2013. High level of losses due to floods in Jakarta can inhibit "
"the development of the city. Therefore, the local government of Jakarta "
"specifically BPBD DKI Jakarta (regional disaster management agencies), need "
"a tool to estimate damages and losses due to flood in rapid manner. "
"Estimation of Jakarta flood damage and losses as one carried out by BAPPENAS "
"(national planning agency), BPBDs (local disaster management agency), and "
"BNPB (national disaster management agency) or other institutions such as the "
"above is still done manually. In 2013, World Bank supports Jakarta BPBD to "
"calculate Damage and Loss Assessment (DaLA) of flood events that occurred "
"early in 2013. It took long time to issue the report. The methodology used "
"at the time was post-disaster survey. It is constrained due to difficulties "
"in obtaining completed data from each of the sectors. For sectors which data "
"is not available, it's calculated using various assumptions. The calculation "
"is fairly complex process because it includes the effects of direct and "
"indirect damage and losses. Indirect impacts including impacts on business "
"processes, micro and macro-economic, social and environmental."

"Jakarta would be the right place to perform this prototype because Flood in "
"Jakarta is nearly occurring yearly in several Villages. Jakarta via Disaster "
"Management Agency (BPBD) already has flood reporting system that reported "
"every day, which area is flooded and at what depth. This data is publicly "
"available and already published an API (Application Programming Interface) "
"which can support as JakSAFE input periodically (Daily or Six-hourly). "
"Worlbank has conduct RW (block) mapping activity in 2013, resulted   2685 RW "
"and 5091 RT has been mapped. The main idea is develop tools that can "
"estimate damages and losses value (in monetary unit) due to flood events, "
"using GIS methodology by utilizes the Flood Events data (in the form of RW "
"block data), Exposure Data (Buildings &amp; Land Parcels) and certain "
"assumptions. Recent development (2016) JakSAFE is updating Hazard area using "
"Contour Delineation model that still under development. In the future, "
"JakSAFE will combine Hazard mapping produced by Hydrological/hydrodynamics "
"Model, improve the physical damage model and improve losses model using more "
"complex micro &amp; macroeconomic parameter &amp; assumptions to get more "
"realistic output of Damage and Loss value. JakSAFE is initially developed by "

"After processing the hazard and exposure data, we have found the number of "

"classify the exposure data into different assets, subsector, and sectors "
"first. Then the assumption is made as a damage and loss matrix in rupiahs of "
"every asset, where every category of asset has its own rupiah damage value "
"and loss value in rupiah. However, sometimes the unit for calculating "
"various assets is not the same, like when calculating building we use unit "
"number of building, however in calculating road we have to use metric unit, "
"and when calculating lake we need to use area as unit. Therefore, we also "
"need to define method of calculation on every category of asset. The other "
"thing to consider when making damage and loss value is that type of flood is "
"have different value, like the loss of building that was inundated by 50 cm "
"of flood will be different with the other that inundated by 200 cm of flood, "
"or the damage value of building that was inundated by flood in 1 day will be "
"different with other that inundated in 5 days, so we also need to categorize "
"the hazard. To summarize it all, we need to categorize the hazard and "
"classifying the exposure data to be able make damage and loss value "
